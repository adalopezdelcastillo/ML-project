# Machine Learning Classification Project

This project was developed as part of coursework in Machine Learning.
The objective was to analyze a large dataset and compare the performance of different supervised learning models.

## Objective

To evaluate and compare the predictive performance of:
- Decision Trees  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
using a structured dataset with multiple features.

## Methodology

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Train-test split
- Model training using scikit-learn
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Performance evaluation using standard classification metrics

## Models Compared

### Decision Trees
- Analysis of splitting criteria
- Model interpretability
- Bias-variance considerations

### Support Vector Machines
- Linear and non-linear kernels
- Margin maximization
- Regularization parameter tuning

### K-Nearest Neighbors
- Distance-based classification
- Sensitivity to k parameter
- Impact of feature scaling

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision and Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
